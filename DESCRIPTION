Description: Estimate the sufficient dimension reduction space using sparsed sliced inverse regression via Lasso (Lasso-SIR) introduced in Lin, Zhao, and Liu (2019) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2018.1520115>. The Lasso-SIR is consistent and achieve the optimal convergence rate under certain sparsity conditions for the multiple index models.
